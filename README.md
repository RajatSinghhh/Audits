# 🔍 Rajat Singh's Smart Contract Audits

Welcome to my personal audit repository where I document smart contract security reviews conducted across various DeFi protocols and Web3 projects.

This repo serves as a public archive of audit findings, methodologies, and project involvements — ranging from contest submissions to independent security reviews.

## 📁 Structure

Each audit is organized in its own folder and includes:

- `Summary.md` – High-level overview of findings
- `Findings.md` – Detailed technical breakdowns
- `Severity.md` – Classification (High / Medium / Low / Informational)
- `Recommendations.md` – Suggestions for fixes
- Any relevant test cases or PoCs (if applicable)

## 🧠 Methodology

I follow a consistent and rigorous auditing approach:

1. **Recon & Architecture Review** – Understand protocol logic & architecture.
2. **Manual Code Review** – Line-by-line analysis for logic flaws & gas optimizations.
3. **Threat Modeling** – Identify critical attack surfaces.
4. **Test-Driven Validation** – Reproduce vulnerabilities using Hardhat/Foundry.
5. **Reporting** – Clear, actionable findings with risk classification.
